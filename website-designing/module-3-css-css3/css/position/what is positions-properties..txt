In CSS, the position property specifies how an element is positioned in a document. It determines the elementâ€™s placement method and how it interacts with other elements. The main values are:

static (default): Element is positioned according to the normal flow of the page.

relative: Element is positioned relative to its normal position.

absolute: Element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.

fixed: Element is positioned relative to the browser window.

sticky: Element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on scroll position.
Note : when we used positions properties we can used to move our section via top, right, bottom, left
You can use top, right, bottom, and left properties with position values (except static) to move the element.
